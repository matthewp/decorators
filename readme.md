__[Decorators](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-components-intro-20130606/#decorator-section)__ were a weird old idea from the web component spec of a long time ago. They never came to fruition but I've never stopped thinking that they were really cool.

What I found compelling about decorators were that they allowed you to do a form of DOM manipulation without JavaScript. What this could mean is that traditional server-rendered apps get some of the power of dynamic web pages without script.

This repo is an attempt to recreate some of that *fun* of decorators using custom elements instead (and of course, that requires script).
